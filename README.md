# Tier 4 Architecture — Enterprise FastAPI Boilerplate

A production-oriented FastAPI starter built around a pragmatic, four-layer architecture (presentation → application → domain → infrastructure). It's meant to be easy to read, straightforward to extend, and to save you the first few weeks of scaffolding a "serious" backend service — auth, CRUD, uploads, real-time hooks, middleware, observability, and configuration are all wired up and working.

## Overview

Tier 4 Architecture is a backend starter focused on clarity and maintainability. It separates concerns into four layers so that business logic, infrastructure concerns, API concerns, and shared utilities remain easy to reason about as the project grows — a change to how you send email shouldn't require touching the router, and a change to a validation rule shouldn't require touching the database layer.

### What you get out of the box

- A fully runnable FastAPI application with health/readiness endpoints and OpenAPI docs (`/docs`, `/redoc`)
- JWT-based authentication with access + refresh tokens, password reset, email verification, and account lockout after repeated failed logins
- Role/permission primitives for admin-style access control
- A sample `products` module demonstrating a second domain with search, sort, and pagination-style listing
- Admin-only product write operations and admin-only user listing, while product reads remain public
- Multipart file upload with authentication, local storage, and static serving
- Subscription billing primitives — plans, features, plan↔feature entitlements, per-user subscriptions, a feature-gate dependency, and Stripe/PayPal checkout + webhook routes (see [Billing and subscriptions](#billing-and-subscriptions))
- Middleware for request correlation (request ID / trace ID), rate limiting, and payload-size protection
- Environment-profile configuration with `*_FILE`-based secret resolution for container/secret-mount deployments
- Pluggable email delivery (console backend for local dev, SMTP for real sending)
- An explicit infrastructure-registration layer wiring logging, Redis, background jobs, and email onto `app.state`
- Socket.IO + a bare WebSocket endpoint for real-time experimentation, including authenticated product-created broadcasts
- Alembic migration scaffolding, a local seed-data script, and an automated test suite covering the flows above
- Docker + Docker Compose (API + Postgres + Redis) and a GitHub Actions CI workflow (lint + test) out of the box

## Why this project

This starter is intentionally practical rather than theoretical — the goal is a structure close to what you'd actually ship, not a textbook diagram:

- Clear separation of concerns across four layers, so features can be added without cross-cutting rewrites
- Fast iteration: the layered pattern in [Development workflow](#development-workflow) is the same for every new feature
- Built-in support for common operational concerns (health checks, rate limiting, request correlation, structured logging)
- Approachable for developers newer to FastAPI or layered architecture — each layer maps to one clear question ("what does this mean for the business," "how do I orchestrate this," "how do I store this," "how do I talk to the outside world")
- A real (if imperfect — see [known limitations](#before-you-ship-this-known-limitations)) test suite around the core flows, so you have a safety net from day one

Whether you're building an internal tool, an early-stage SaaS backend, or a learning project on layered architecture, this gives you a working structure to build on rather than a blank `main.py`.

1. **Presentation layer** — FastAPI routers and handlers, Pydantic request/response validation, WebSocket and Socket.IO endpoints, OpenAPI documentation.
2. **Application layer** — explicit use cases (e.g. `RegisterUserUseCase`, `LoginUseCase`, `CreateProductUseCase`) that orchestrate a business workflow end to end, plus ports that describe outbound integrations without binding the domain to a specific SDK.
3. **Domain layer** — business logic in services, persistence access in repositories, entities as SQLAlchemy models, and `DomainEvent`s for communicating meaningful state changes.
4. **Infrastructure layer** — async SQLAlchemy sessions, the Redis client, email transport, explicit startup/shutdown registration for logging/cache/background jobs, and deployment-oriented configuration.

For the full request-by-request walkthrough of how a call moves through these layers, see [docs/DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/DOCUMENTATION.md#2-request-lifecycle-in-detail).

## HTTP Request Lifecycle

Every incoming HTTP request passes through a series of middleware components before reaching an API endpoint. Each middleware focuses on a single responsibility, keeping the request pipeline modular and easy to extend.

| Stage                      | Responsibility                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| RequestSizeLimitMiddleware | Protects the application from oversized request bodies by validating the streamed payload size.  |
| Request Context            | Generates a unique Request ID and Trace ID for request correlation.                              |
| Logging Context            | Binds request metadata into ContextVars so every log automatically includes request information. |
| Rate Limiter               | Rejects clients exceeding the configured request limit with HTTP 429.                            |
| OpenTelemetry              | Creates a tracing span around the request lifecycle for observability.                           |
| Router                     | Resolves the incoming route and executes dependencies.                                           |
| Endpoint                   | Runs the application or domain logic.                                                            |
| Security Headers           | Adds common HTTP security headers before sending the response.                                   |
| Metrics                    | Updates in-process request counters exposed through `/metrics`.                                  |
| Audit Logger               | Records security-sensitive operations for auditing.                                              |
| Structured Logger          | Writes request completion logs including request ID, trace ID, status code, and latency.         |

### Design Principles

The middleware pipeline follows a single-responsibility design where each component performs one well-defined task before passing the request to the next stage.

Benefits include:

- Request correlation across distributed services using Request IDs and Trace IDs.
- Centralized security through middleware instead of individual endpoints.
- Automatic structured logging without polluting business logic.
- Early request rejection for oversized payloads and rate-limited clients.
- Consistent observability through tracing, metrics, and audit logging.
- Clean separation between infrastructure concerns and application logic.

## Layer Interaction

Once a request passes through the middleware pipeline, it enters the application's four-layer architecture. Each layer has a single responsibility and communicates only with its adjacent layer, reducing coupling and improving maintainability.

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer              | Responsibility                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Presentation**   | Receives HTTP requests, performs validation, authentication, middleware execution, and returns HTTP responses.    |
| **Application**    | Coordinates use cases, orchestrates workflows, and manages transactions without containing business rules.        |
| **Domain**         | Implements business logic, validation rules, entities, repositories, and domain services.                         |
| **Infrastructure** | Provides database access, Redis, email services, file storage, tracing, logging, and other external integrations. |

### Design Principles

- Business logic remains independent from HTTP and database implementations.
- Infrastructure concerns are isolated behind abstractions.
- Each layer has a single responsibility.
- Dependencies flow inward toward the domain.
- Features can evolve independently without affecting unrelated layers.

## Core features

### Authentication and session management

- User registration, login, and logout
- Access-token + refresh-token issuance and rotation, with revocation on logout
- Password reset (request/confirm) and email verification (request/confirm) flows
- Account lockout after repeated failed login attempts
- Lightweight, pluggable email notifications for the flows above (console backend by default, SMTP for real environments)

### User and admin workflows

- CRUD endpoints for users, plus a `/me` profile route for the current authenticated user
- Admin-only user listing, plus an admin-only role/permission-change endpoint (`PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/{user_id}/role`) demonstrating policy-based access checks
- Role (`role`) and explicit `permissions` list on the user model, evaluated through a small `AuthorizationPolicy`/`PermissionPolicy` layer

### Product module

A second domain module included to show the same layered pattern applied twice:

- Create, read, update, delete for authenticated admin/staff users
- Search (`search`), pagination-style listing (`skip`/`limit`), and sorting (`sort`/`order`) on the public list endpoint
- OpenAPI examples on the request/response schemas

### Files and media

- Multipart upload endpoint (`POST /api/v1/uploads/`), with extension allow-listing and magic-byte validation for binary types
- Local disk storage by default, with server-generated UUID filenames; files are served back only through the authenticated, ownership-checked `GET /api/v1/uploads/{stored_name}` route — there is **no** public `/static/uploads` mount
- Pluggable cloud storage backends (`UPLOAD_BACKEND=s3` / `azure`) already implemented in `backend/infrastructure/upload_storage.py`, alongside the default `local` backend

### Billing and subscriptions

A plan/feature/subscription system for gating functionality behind paid tiers, plus checkout and webhook plumbing for Stripe and PayPal:

- `Plan`, `Feature`, `PlanFeature`, and `Subscription` models (`backend/domain/billing/models.py`) — plans have a price, billing interval, and active flag; features are mapped to plans many-to-many; subscriptions link a user to a plan with a `status` (`active`/`trialing`/`canceled`/…) and `provider` (`manual`/`stripe`/`paypal`)
- Admin endpoints (require the `billing.manage` RBAC permission) to create plans and features, map features onto a plan, assign a subscription directly, toggle `subscriptions_enabled`/`payment_providers_enabled` at runtime, and pull basic subscription metrics
- A `GET /api/v1/billing/feature-check` route and a `require_feature("<key>")` FastAPI dependency (`backend/core/security/entitlements.py`) that superusers and users with a matching active/trialing plan pass, and everyone else gets a `402 Payment Required` with an `upgrade_url` — this is the primitive to gate any route or feature behind a plan
- `POST /api/v1/billing/checkout` to start a Stripe or PayPal checkout session and `POST /api/v1/billing/webhooks/stripe` to receive provider webhooks, with idempotent processing (a Redis-backed idempotency store plus a unique `(provider, provider_event_id)` constraint on the persisted `PaymentEvent` row) so a redelivered webhook can't double-apply
- Self-service `GET /api/v1/billing/plans`, `GET /api/v1/billing/subscriptions/me`, and `POST /api/v1/billing/subscriptions/cancel` routes for the current user
- **Heads up:** `settings.subscriptions_enabled` can currently be toggled two independent ways — `PATCH /api/v1/billing/admin/settings` (needs `billing.manage`) and `PATCH /api/v1/admin/system/subscriptions-enabled` (needs `system.billing_toggle`) — both work, neither is wrong, but it's worth consolidating onto one before relying on it operationally.
- **Current caveat:** `StripeAdapter`/`PayPalAdapter` (`backend/integrations/stripe_adapter.py`, `backend/integrations/paypal_adapter.py`) are lightweight stand-ins today — they don't call the real Stripe/PayPal SDKs or APIs, they just return deterministic fake customer/session ids and treat any non-empty signature header as "verified." The plan/feature/subscription/webhook _data model and workflow_ are real and tested; swapping in the actual provider SDKs is the remaining step before this is production-ready payment processing. See [known limitations](#before-you-ship-this-known-limitations).

### Reliability and observability

- Request ID / trace ID generation and propagation via `x-request-id` / `x-trace-id` headers, bound into the logging context for correlation
- In-memory rate limiting (single-instance; see [known limitations](#before-you-ship-this-known-limitations) for multi-instance caveats)
- Request-size protection for oversized payloads
- `/health` (liveness) and `/health/ready` (DB + Redis ping) endpoints
- `/metrics` (in-process request counters) and `/runtime` (operational snapshot: environment, uptime, metrics) endpoints
- Span-style tracing hooks around HTTP requests, login, product creation, and uploads (structured logging today — see [known limitations](#before-you-ship-this-known-limitations) for the gap between this and a wired-up OpenTelemetry exporter)

### Real-time support

- Socket.IO server mounted at `/socket.io` with `connect`/`disconnect`/`ping` handlers and authenticated product-created broadcasts
- A bare WebSocket endpoint at `/ws/health` for connection testing

## Project structure

- [backend/app](backend/app) — API routers, the app factory, bootstrap registration (middleware/routers/static), and Socket.IO wiring
- [backend/application](backend/application) — use cases per feature (`users/`, `products/`, `auth/`, `billing/`), plus shared ports and application-level services
- [backend/domain](backend/domain) — per-feature services, repositories, and models (`users/`, `products/`, `billing/`, `rbac/`), plus `events/` for domain events
- [backend/database](backend/database) — async engine/session setup and the shared declarative base
- [backend/common](backend/common) — shared cross-cutting code: schemas, base repository/service classes, background jobs, bootstrap/exporters helpers
- [backend/infrastructure](backend/infrastructure) — startup/shutdown wiring that attaches logging, Redis, background jobs, and email onto `app.state`; also the `PlatformRuntime` facade backing `/runtime` (`backend/infrastructure/runtime.py`)
- [backend/integrations](backend/integrations) — adapters bridging the domain to external systems: email, plus `stripe_adapter.py`/`paypal_adapter.py` for billing checkout/webhooks (see [Billing and subscriptions](#billing-and-subscriptions) for their current stub-vs-real-SDK status)
- [backend/core/security](backend/core/security) — auth dependencies, RBAC/role and permission checks (`rbac.py`), the plan/feature entitlement gate (`entitlements.py`), and token issuance/rotation/revocation
- [backend/resilience](backend/resilience) — rate limiting and the retry/circuit-breaker primitives
- [backend/observability](backend/observability) — structured logging, audit trail, metrics, and tracing
- [backend/contracts](backend/contracts) — API-facing contract definitions exposed through `backend/contracts/__init__.py`
- [backend/utils](backend/utils) — the Redis client and small runtime helpers
- [backend/scripts](backend/scripts) — local dev seed-data script
- [tests](tests) — the automated test suite
- [alembic](alembic) — migration environment and versions
- [deployment](deployment) — per-environment `.env` templates

> **Note:** `backend/platform/`, `backend/services/`, and `backend/common/pagination.py` do **not** exist in this codebase, despite being referenced in places elsewhere in this README/DOCUMENTATION.md history — `PlatformRuntime` actually lives in `backend/infrastructure/runtime.py`, and there is no separate pagination or runtime-service module.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10–3.14
- A virtual environment tool (venv, conda, etc.)
- Postgres and Redis reachable at the URLs in your `.env` (or use Docker Compose, below, to get both for free)
- Optional: Docker and Docker Compose for containerized development

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd tier4-fastapi-boilerplate
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or, for local development with lint/type-check/test tooling:
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Copy [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env` and adjust the values.

At minimum, review before running anything beyond local dev:

| Variable                                                                    | Why it matters                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`                                                              | Points at your Postgres instance.                                                                                                 |
| `REDIS_URL`                                                                 | Points at your Redis instance.                                                                                                    |
| `SECRET_KEY`                                                                | JWT signing key — **must** be changed outside local dev.                                                                          |
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Used by the seed script to bootstrap an admin — **must** be changed outside local dev.                                            |
| `EMAIL_BACKEND` + `SMTP_*`                                                  | Switch from console-only email to real SMTP delivery.                                                                             |
| `CORS_ORIGINS`                                                              | Restrict to your real frontend origin(s) in any shared environment.                                                               |
| `ENABLE_TRACING` / `OTEL_MODE` / `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`              | Tracing configuration — see [known limitations](#before-you-ship-this-known-limitations) for what this does and doesn't do today. |

### 5. Run database migrations (optional for local dev, required beyond it)

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

The app's startup lifecycle will also call `create_all` for convenience in local dev, but that's not a substitute for migrations anywhere the schema needs to evolve safely.

### 6. (Optional) Seed local data

```bash
python -m backend.scripts.seed_data
```

Creates a default admin account and two example products if they don't already exist. **Local development only** — see [known limitations](#before-you-ship-this-known-limitations).

### 7. Run the application

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

The API docs will be available at:

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

### 8. Optional: run with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This brings up the API alongside `postgres:16-alpine` and `redis:7-alpine`, so you don't need either installed locally to try the project.

## Configuration

The application uses environment-based configuration (`pydantic-settings`) with support for profile-specific files and secret-file resolution, so credentials don't need to live in the source tree.

Load order (highest precedence last): `ENV_FILE` (if set) → `.env` → `.env.<environment>` → `.env.<environment>.local` → `.env.local` → real process environment variables → field defaults.

Settings roughly group into:

- **Project metadata** — name, API version prefix (`API_V1_STR`)
- **Database & cache** — `DATABASE_URL`(`_FILE`), `REDIS_URL`(`_FILE`)
- **Auth** — `SECRET_KEY`(`_FILE`), `ALGORITHM`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`, `PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_TTL_MINUTES`
- **CORS** — `CORS_ORIGINS`
- **Rate limiting & payload protection** — `ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING`, `RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `MAX_REQUEST_SIZE_BYTES`
- **Uploads** — `UPLOAD_DIR`
- **Billing & subscriptions** — `SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED` (master toggle for feature-gating, off by default), `PAYMENT_PROVIDERS_ENABLED` (allow-list of checkout providers, e.g. `stripe,paypal`), `DISABLED_FEATURES` (feature keys forced off regardless of plan) — all also patchable at runtime by an admin via `PATCH /api/v1/billing/admin/settings`
- **Email** — `EMAIL_BACKEND` (`console`/`smtp`), `SMTP_HOST`/`SMTP_PORT`/`SMTP_USERNAME`/`SMTP_PASSWORD`/`SMTP_USE_TLS`/`SMTP_USE_SSL`/`SMTP_FROM_EMAIL`
- **Seed admin** — `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL`/`DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME`/`DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- **Transport security** — `REQUIRE_HTTPS`
- **Tracing** — `ENABLE_TRACING`, `OTEL_MODE`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`

The full field-by-field reference (defaults and purpose for every setting) is in [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md#5-configuration--environment-variables-reference).

If you're deploying anywhere shared, provide secrets via real environment variables or the `*_FILE` settings (pointing at a mounted secret file) — never commit real credentials to a `.env`.

## API reference

All routes below live under `API_V1_STR` (default `/api/v1`) unless noted otherwise. See [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md#4-full-api-endpoint-reference) for the complete table including which routes currently require authentication.

## Backend & API endpoint guide

A practical, copy-pasteable reference for every route the backend exposes — request shape, response shape, auth requirements, and where the implementation lives. This is the "how do I actually call this" companion to the summary table in [API reference](#api-reference) above; for the layered-architecture story behind each route, see [DOCUMENTATION.md §4](docs/DOCUMENTATION.md#4-full-api-endpoint-reference).

Unless stated otherwise, all endpoints below are mounted under `API_V1_STR` (default `/api/v1`) and return/accept JSON. Auth uses a standard `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header, obtained from `/auth/login` or `/auth/refresh`.

### Auth (`backend/app/api/v1/auth/router.py`)

| Method | Path                               | Auth                                   | Body / query                                                            | Success response                                                                                |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/auth/login`                      | None (this _is_ login)                 | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` OAuth2 form: `username`, `password` | `200` → `{ access_token, refresh_token, token_type }`                                           |
| POST   | `/auth/refresh`                    | None (bearer of a valid refresh token) | JSON `{ refresh_token }`                                                | `200` → new `{ access_token, refresh_token, token_type }`                                       |
| POST   | `/auth/logout`                     | Bearer access token                    | JSON `{ refresh_token }`                                                | `200` → `{ detail: "Logged out" }`; revokes both the refresh token and the access token's `jti` |
| POST   | `/auth/email-verification/request` | None                                   | JSON `{ email }`                                                        | `200` → `{ detail }`                                                                            |
| POST   | `/auth/email-verification/confirm` | None (bearer of the emailed token)     | JSON `{ token }`                                                        | `200` → `{ detail }`                                                                            |
| POST   | `/auth/password-reset/request`     | None                                   | JSON `{ email }`                                                        | `200` → `{ detail }`                                                                            |
| POST   | `/auth/password-reset/confirm`     | None (bearer of the emailed token)     | JSON `{ token, new_password }`                                          | `200` → `{ detail }`                                                                            |
| GET    | `/auth/me`                         | Bearer access token                    | —                                                                       | `200` → `UserOut` for the caller                                                                |

Notes:

- `/auth/login` is rate-limited on two axes independently — up to 10 attempts/minute per normalized `username` and up to 30/minute per client IP — before falling through to the domain login check; both return the same `401` either way, so failed attempts don't reveal whether an account exists.
- Repeated failed logins against a real account also trip the domain-level lockout in `UserService`, independent of the rate limiter.
- Passwords (`UserCreate.password`, `PasswordResetConfirm.new_password`) must satisfy `^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[^A-Za-z0-9]).{8,}$` — at least 8 characters with upper, lower, digit, and special character.

### Users (`backend/app/api/v1/users/router.py`)

Notes:

- Gate any route or feature behind a plan with the `require_feature("<key>")` dependency (`backend/core/security/entitlements.py`) instead of re-implementing the `feature-check` logic — it's the same plan/feature lookup used by `GET /billing/feature-check`, returning `402` with an `upgrade_url` on the same shape.
- Superusers and, when `subscriptions_enabled=false` (the default), _every_ user bypass the feature gate entirely — so the gate is inert until you explicitly turn `SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED=true` on.
- `mrr_cents` in the metrics response is currently computed by summing `plan_id` values, not `price_cents` — it's a placeholder shape for the response contract, not a real MRR calculation yet.
- `StripeAdapter`/`PayPalAdapter` are mock adapters — `create_checkout_session` returns a deterministic fake `checkout_url`/`customer_id` without calling out to Stripe/PayPal, and `verify_webhook_signature` accepts any non-empty signature header as valid. Swap these for the real `stripe`/`paypal` SDKs before processing real payments.

### Authorization model, at a glance

- **Bearer auth**: every protected route depends on `get_current_active_user` (`backend/core/security/dependencies.py`), which validates the JWT, checks it against the revocation store, and loads the user.
- **Role checks**: `require_role("admin")` / `require_role("admin", "staff")` (`backend/core/security/rbac.py`) allow the given `role` values or any `is_superuser` account.
- **Ownership checks**: user and upload routes additionally compare the resource's owner id against the caller (or require `is_superuser`) directly in the route handler.
- **Fine-grained permissions**: the `permissions: list[str]` field on `User` plus `AuthorizationPolicy`/`require_policy` exist for policies that need more than a role name, though no current route uses `require_policy` — `require_role` covers every route in this codebase today.

### Error shape

Domain errors are translated to HTTP by `backend/web/exceptions.py` and generally look like:

```json
{ "message": "Incorrect email or password", "error_code": null }
```

with a matching HTTP status (`400` validation, `401` unauthorized, `403` forbidden, `404` not found, `409` conflict on integrity errors, `429` rate-limited). Pydantic validation failures instead return FastAPI's default `422` shape with a `detail` array of field-level errors.

## Development workflow

1. Keep routers thin — parse the request, call a use case, translate the result/errors into a response.
2. Put business rules into domain services, not route handlers.
3. Keep repositories focused on persistence and query logic only.
4. Reuse the shared abstractions in [backend/common](backend/common) (auth dependencies, exceptions, schemas) rather than re-implementing them per feature.
5. Prefer explicit, validated Pydantic schemas over ad-hoc dictionaries — and be deliberate about which fields a schema exposes to which caller (see the registration note in [known limitations](#before-you-ship-this-known-limitations)).
6. Register new startup/shutdown infrastructure concerns through [backend/infrastructure/runtime.py](backend/infrastructure/runtime.py) rather than scattering wiring through the app.
7. Add a regression test whenever behavior changes — both a use-case/service-level test and a route-level test through `TestClient`.

### Adding a new feature module

1. Domain model in [backend/domain/\<feature\>/model.py](backend/domain)
2. Repository for persistence in `backend/domain/<feature>/repository.py`
3. Domain service for business rules in `backend/domain/<feature>/service.py`
4. Application use case(s) in `backend/application/<feature>/use_cases.py` to orchestrate the workflow
5. Request/response schemas in [backend/common/schema.py](backend/common/schema.py)
6. API routes under [backend/app/api/v1/\<feature\>/](backend/app/api/v1)
7. Register the router in [backend/app/api/v1/router.py](backend/app/api/v1/router.py)
8. Any supporting infrastructure (storage, cache, background jobs, an outbound adapter under `backend/integrations/`)

The full walkthrough with the reasoning behind each step is in [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md#6-how-to-implement-a-new-feature-step-by-step).

## Testing

Requires the `dev` extra (it pulls in `aiosqlite`, which the test suite's in-memory SQLite fixtures depend on but which isn't part of the base `requirements.txt`):

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Run the full suite with:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Or, matching CI exactly:

```bash
ruff check backend tests
python -m pytest -q
```

- The suite covers authentication/authorization flows, user and product CRUD (including negative/duplicate/validation cases), health and readiness endpoints, upload handling, WebSocket/Socket.IO interaction, trace-header propagation, middleware branches for rate limiting and request-size protection, and seed-data initialization. See [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md#9-testing-strategy) for a file-by-file breakdown of what each test module actually checks.

## Deployment notes

The project ships with a working `Dockerfile` (non-root user, healthcheck against `/health`) and `docker-compose.yml` (API + Postgres + Redis), plus a GitHub Actions workflow that lints and tests every push/PR to `main`/`master`.

Before deploying beyond local development:

- Use a real, non-default database and Redis instance — not the compose file's `postgres`/`postgres` local credentials.
- Provide all credentials via environment variables or mounted secret files (the `*_FILE` settings exist for exactly this).
- Change `SECRET_KEY` and `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` away from their defaults — nothing currently stops the app from booting with the defaults in place, so this is on you to enforce.
- Put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy in front, and set `REQUIRE_HTTPS=true`.
- Read [known limitations](#before-you-ship-this-known-limitations) below and address the ones relevant to your deployment (especially the endpoint-auth and rate-limiter/audit-log scalability notes) — they're not edge cases, they're gaps in the current baseline.
- Wire `/health/ready` and `/runtime` into your orchestrator's readiness probes and dashboards.

## Before you ship this: known limitations

This is a boilerplate, and boilerplates get copied into real projects wholesale more often than they get read line-by-line first. This section has been re-verified directly against the current source tree (code read, migrations run, full test suite run, `ruff` run — not just documentation review). Headline results:

- **Most previously-known security gaps in this boilerplate are already fixed in the current code** — public registration already can't self-assign `role`/`permissions` (`UserCreate` forbids extra fields), uploaded filenames are already UUID-generated with path-traversal protection and per-owner access checks (no public static mount), login lockout and Socket.IO auth already avoid enumeration/stale-token gaps, and `/metrics`/`/runtime` already require an admin token.
- **Four items previously flagged as open have since been fixed in the source** and are safe to treat as resolved: `aiosqlite` is now declared in the `dev` extra in `pyproject.toml` (so `pip install -e .[dev] && pytest -q` works out of the box); `backend/resilience/retry.py`'s `CircuitBreaker` is now wired into `SMTPEmailTransport` (`backend/infrastructure/email/transport.py`); `BaseRepository.create()`/`update()` (`backend/common/base_repository.py`) no longer accept a raw `dict` — `create()` requires a model instance or a schema with `model_dump()`, and `update()` requires a schema, closing the mass-assignment path; and the insecure-default guard in `backend/core/config.py` (`_reject_insecure_prod_defaults`) now fires for both `environment=prod` **and** `environment=staging`.
- **What's still genuinely open today:** `ruff check backend tests` currently reports 12 lint errors — down from a previously-reported 24 — all confined to `tests/` (unused `pytest` imports and a `client` fixture re-imported then redefined in a few files), 5 of which are auto-fixable with `ruff check backend tests --fix`. This would still block the CI workflow's Lint step before tests run, but it's a test-only cleanup, not an application-code issue.
- **Rate limiting is Redis-backed outside of local dev**, with an in-memory fallback if Redis becomes unreachable (fails open to degraded limiting, not a full outage) — the only remaining single-process ceiling is in `dev` or during a Redis outage.
- **Tracing and metrics are lightweight by design** — the tracing hooks produce structured logs today, not a wired-up OpenTelemetry exporter pipeline, and `/metrics`/`/runtime` are process-local snapshots (though they are admin-authenticated), not a Prometheus-scrape endpoint or cross-instance aggregate.
- **Cloud upload backends already exist** — `UploadStorage`'s `S3UploadStorage`/`AzureUploadStorage` implementations live in `backend/infrastructure/upload_storage.py` today; switching from local disk is a matter of setting `UPLOAD_BACKEND=s3` (or `azure`) plus the matching credentials, not writing new code. Downloading through the API when a remote backend is active isn't implemented yet (`GET /api/v1/uploads/{stored_name}` returns `501` for non-`local` backends) — issue a signed URL from the provider instead.
- **`backend/platform/`, `backend/services/`, and `backend/common/pagination.py` don't exist** in this codebase — see the note in [Project structure](#project-structure) if you've seen those paths referenced elsewhere in this project's history.
- **Billing/subscriptions already exists in the source but was missing from this documentation** — a full plan/feature/subscription system, admin management routes, a `require_feature()` entitlement gate, and Stripe/PayPal checkout + idempotent webhook handling are implemented and covered by `tests/test_billing_hardening.py`; see [Billing and subscriptions](#billing-and-subscriptions). The gap that remains is real: `StripeAdapter`/`PayPalAdapter` are mock implementations that don't call the actual provider APIs, so this isn't yet wired to real payments.

## Roadmap

- Clean up the remaining `ruff` lint errors in `tests/` (unused imports, a redefined `client` fixture) so CI's lint step goes green
- Wire up a real OpenTelemetry SDK + OTLP exporter for auth, database, Redis, and Socket.IO boundaries, replacing today's logging-only span bridge
- Move rate limiting fully onto Redis in every environment (not just `environment != "dev"`), so local dev exercises the same code path as production
- Implement download proxying (or signed-URL issuance) for `GET /api/v1/uploads/{stored_name}` when a remote (`s3`/`azure`) upload backend is active — the storage backends themselves already exist, this is the missing read path
- Move the audit log onto persistent, queryable storage (today it's `logs/audit.jsonl` plus structured logging) so it holds up under horizontal scaling and restarts
- Add contract tests for API schemas and backward compatibility
- Replace the mock `StripeAdapter`/`PayPalAdapter` (`backend/integrations/`) with real Stripe/PayPal SDK calls and real webhook signature verification — the plan/feature/subscription data model, entitlement gate, and idempotent webhook handling already exist and are tested; only the outbound HTTP calls to the providers are stubbed
- Round out the billing module with proration, trial-period expiry, dunning/retry on failed payments, and an invoice/payment-history endpoint — today `Subscription` only tracks current `status`/`provider`, not history
- Introduce an outbox pattern and event publisher so `DomainEvent`s are actually propagated somewhere, not just logged
- Formalize environment promotion (dev → staging → prod) for container-based deployment
